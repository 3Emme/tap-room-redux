# __tap-room__

#### __A site for managing kegs in an all-kombucha taproom. November 20, 2020__

#### By _**Emme Buentiempo**_

## Description

This application was created as an Epicodus assignment, with the intent to have it serve as a demonstration of knowledge after the program's 16th week. For the time being this README will serve as a checklist to demonstrate the satisfaction of all project requirements and objectives. 

## Project requirements:

This will be a two-week project. Spend today building a tap room in React where a bar or kombucha store can track their kegs. This could also be a soda fountain or another kind of tracker - as long as you're able to track the remaining amount and meet the objectives, you can be creative with this prompt.

Before getting started, plan out your application and draw a component tree or component diagram that shows the structure of your components. This is a requirement for the project and should be included in your README. You may draw the structure on a piece of paper and take a picture of it or use an application like https://www.draw.io/.

Here are some user stories to get you started. The application should have the following functionality:

As a user, I want to see a list/menu of all available kegs. For each keg, I want to see its name, brand, price and alcoholContent (or perhaps something like flavor for a kombucha store). [Complete]
As a user, I want to submit a form to add a new keg to a list. [Complete]
As a user, I want to be able to click on a keg to see its detail page. [Complete]
As a user, I want to see how many pints are left in a keg. Hint: A full keg has roughly 124 pints. [Complete]
As a user, I want to be able to click a button next to a keg whenever I sell a pint of it. This should decrease the number of pints left by 1. Pints should not be able to go below 0. [Complete]

## Project Objectives:

  * Application compiles and runs and all required functionality is included. [Complete]
  * Functional and class components are used correctly. [Complete]
  * Application effectively uses local and shared state. [Complete]
  * Props are used correctly and always include PropTypes. [Complete]
  * README includes an accurate representation of the application's component tree. [Complete]
  * Project was submitted by the deadline. [Complete]
  * Project demonstrates an understanding of this week's concepts. If prompted, you can discuss your code with an instructor using the correct terminology. [Complete]
